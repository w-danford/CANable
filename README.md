# CANable

(Built January 2017, uploaded to github May 2020.)

CANable is a USB-to-CAN interface module. This entire project consists of both hardware and firmware. I created this firmware distribution from a version by [Ethan Zonca](https://github.com/normaldotcom).

The hardware, according to Ethan, is licensed under Creative Commons and firmware is under the MIT License (MIT). The CAD tool is [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview).
